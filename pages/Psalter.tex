\subsection{Book I\\Day 1: Morning Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 1: \textit{Beatus vir qui non abiit.}}
\lett{B}{lessed} is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, * and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.\par
2 But his delight is in the law of the {\textsc{Lord}}; * and in his law will he exercise himself day and night.\par
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the water-side, * that will bring forth his fruit in due season.\par
4 His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.\par
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.\par
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgement, * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\par
7 But the {\textsc{Lord}} knoweth the way of the righteous; * and the way of the ungodly shall perish.
\psa{Psalm 2: \textit{Quare fremuerunt gentes?}}
\lett{W}{hy} do the heathen so furiously rage together? * and why do the people imagine a vain thing?\par
2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together * against the {\textsc{Lord}}, and against his Anointed:\par
3 Let us break their bonds asunder, * and cast away their cords from us.\par
4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh them to scorn: * the Lord shall have them in derision.\par
5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, * and vex them in his sore displeasure:\par
6 Yet have I set my King * upon my holy hill of Sion.\par
7 I will rehearse the decree; * the {\textsc{Lord}} hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.\par
8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, * and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.\par
9 Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of iron, * and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.\par
10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; * be instructed, ye that are judges of the earth.\par
11 Serve the {\textsc{Lord}} in fear, * and rejoice unto him with reverence.\par
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and so ye perish from the right way, if his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. * Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
\psa{Psalm 3: \textit{Domine, quid multiplicati?}}
\lett{L}{ord}, how are they increased that trouble me! * many are they that rise against me.\par
2 Many one there be that say of my soul, * There is no help for him in his God.\par
3 But thou, O {\textsc{Lord}}, art my defender; * thou art my worship, and the lifter up of my head.\par
4 I did call upon the {\textsc{Lord}} with my voice, * and he heard me out of his holy hill.\par
5 I laid me down and slept, and rose up again; * for the {\textsc{Lord}} sustained me.\par
6 I will not be afraid for ten thousands of the people, * that have set themselves against me round about.\par
7 Up, {\textsc{Lord}}, and help me, O my God, * for thou smitest all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.\par
8 Salvation belongeth unto the {\textsc{Lord}}; * and thy blessing is upon thy people.
\psa{Psalm 4: \textit{Cum invocarem.}}
\lett{H}{ear} me when I call, O God of my righteousness: * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer.\par
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour, * and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?\par
3 Know this also, that the {\textsc{Lord}} hath chosen to himself the man that is godly; * when I call upon the {\textsc{Lord}} he will hear me.\par
4 Stand in awe, and sin not; * commune with your own heart, and in your chamber, and be still.\par
5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, * and put your trust in the {\textsc{Lord}}.\par
6 There be many that say, * Who will show us any good?\par
7 {\textsc{Lord}}, lift thou up* the light of thy countenance upon us.\par
8 Thou hast put gladness in my heart; * yea, more than when their corn and wine and oil increase.\par
9 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; * for it is thou, {\textsc{Lord}}, only, that makest me dwell in safety.
\psa{Psalm 5: \textit{Verba mea auribus.}}
\lett{P}{onder} my words, O {\textsc{Lord}}, * consider my meditation.\par
2 O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.\par
3 My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O {\textsc{Lord}}; * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.\par
4 For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness; * neither shall any evil dwell with thee.\par
5 Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight; * for thou hatest all them that work iniquity.\par
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: * the {\textsc{Lord}} will abhor both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.\par
7 But as for me, in the multitude of thy mercy I will come into thine house; * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.\par
8 Lead me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies; * make thy way plain before my face.\par
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * their inward parts are very wickedness.\par
10 Their throat is an open sepulchre; * they flatter with their tongue.\par
11 Destroy thou them, O God; let them perish through their own imaginations; * cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have rebelled against thee.\par
12 And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them; they that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee;\par
13 For thou, {\textsc{Lord}}, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous, * and with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him as with a shield.
\subsection{Evening Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 6: \textit{Domine, ne in furore.}}
\lett{O}{Lord}, rebuke me not in thine indignation, * neither chasten me in thy displeasure.\par
2 Have mercy upon me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, for I am weak; * O {\textsc{Lord}}, heal me, for my bones are vexed.\par
3 My soul also is sore troubled: * but, {\textsc{Lord}}, how long wilt thou punish me?\par
4 Turn thee, O {\textsc{Lord}}, and deliver my soul; * O save me, for thy mercy's sake.\par
5 For in death no man remembereth thee; * and who will give thee thanks in the pit?\par
6 I am weary of my groaning; * every night wash I my bed, and water my couch with my tears.\par
7 My beauty is gone for very trouble, * and worn away because of all mine enemies.\par
8 Away from me, all ye that work iniquity; * for the {\textsc{Lord}} hath heard the voice of my weeping.\par
9 The {\textsc{Lord}} hath heard my petition; * the {\textsc{Lord}} will receive my prayer.\par
10 All mine enemies shall be confounded, and sore vexed; * they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.
\psa{Psalm 7: \textit{Domine, Deus meus.}}
\lett{O}{Lord} my God, in thee have I put my trust: * save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me;\par
2 Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, * while there is none to help.\par
3 O{\textsc{Lord}} my God, if I have done any such thing; * or if there be any wickedness in my hands;\par
4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that dealt friendly with me; * (yea, I have delivered him that without any cause is mine enemy;)
5 Then let mine enemy persecute my soul, and take me; * yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.\par
6 Stand up, O {\textsc{Lord}}, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself,\par
because of the indignation of mine enemies; * arise up for me in the judgement that thou hast commanded.\par
7 And so shall the congregation of the peoples come about thee: * for their sakes therefore lift up thyself again.\par
8 The {\textsc{Lord}} shall judge the peoples: give sentence with me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, * according to my righteousness, and according to the innocency that is in me.\par
9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * but guide thou the just.\par
10 For the righteous God * trieth the very hearts and reins.\par
11 My help cometh of God, * who preserveth them that are true of heart.\par
12 God is a righteous Judge, strong, and patient; * and God is provoked every day.\par
13 If a man will not turn, he will whet his sword; * he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.\par
14 He hath prepared for him the instruments of death; * he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.\par
15 Behold, the ungodly travaileth with iniquity; * he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.\par
16 He hath graven and digged up a pit, * and is fallen himself into the destruction that he made for other.\par
17 For his travail shall come upon his own head, * and his wickedness shall fall on his own pate.\par
18 I will give thanks unto the {\textsc{Lord}}, according to his righteousness; * and I will praise the Name of the {\textsc{Lord}} Most High.
\psa{Psalm 8: \textit{Domine, Dominus noster.}}
\lett{O}{Lord} our Governor, how excellent is thy Name in all the world; * thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens!
2 Out of the mouth of very babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, * that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.\par
3 When I consider thy heavens, even the work of thy fingers; * the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;\par
4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? * and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\par
5 Thou madest him lower than the angels, * to crown him with glory and worship.\par
6 Thou makest him to have dominion of the works of thy hands; * and thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet:\par
7 All sheep and oxen; * yea, and the beasts of the field;\par
8 The fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea; * and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas.\par
9 O {\textsc{Lord}} our Governor, * how excellent is thy Name in all the world!
\subsection{Day 2: Morning Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 9: \textit{Confitebor tibi.}}
\lett{I}{will} give thanks unto thee, O {\textsc{Lord}}, with my whole heart; * I will speak of all thy marvellous works.\par
2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; * yea, my songs will I make of thy Name, O thou Most Highest.\par
3 While mine enemies are driven back, * they shall fall and perish at thy presence.\par
4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; * thou art set in the throne that judgest right.\par
5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, and destroyed the ungodly; * thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.\par
6 O thou enemy, thy destructions are come to a perpetual end; * even as the cities which thou hast destroyed, whose memorial is perished with them.\par
7 But the {\textsc{Lord}} shall endure for ever; * he hath also prepared his seat for judgement.\par
8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * and minister true judgement unto the people.\par
9 The {\textsc{Lord}} also will be a defence for the oppressed, * even a refuge in due time of trouble.\par
10 And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee; * for thou, {\textsc{Lord}}, hast never failed them that seek thee.\par
11 O praise the {\textsc{Lord}} which dwelleth in Sion; * show the people of his doings.\par
12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them, * and forgetteth not the complaint of the poor.\par
13 Have mercy upon me, O {\textsc{Lord}}; consider the trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, * thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;\par
14 That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of Sion: * I will rejoice in thy salvation.\par
15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; * in the same net which they hid privily is their foot taken.\par
16 The {\textsc{Lord}} is known to execute judgement; * the ungodly is trapped in the work of his own hands.\par
17 The wicked shall be turned to destruction, * and all the people that forget God.\par
18 For the poor shall not alway be forgotten; * the patient abiding of the meek shall not perish for ever.\par
19 Up, {\textsc{Lord}}, and let not man have the upper hand; * let the heathen be judged in thy sight.\par
20 Put them in fear, O {\textsc{Lord}}, * that the heathen may know themselves to be but men.
\psa{Psalm 10: \textit{Ut quid, Domine ?}}
\lett{W}{hy} standest thou so far off, O {\textsc{Lord}}, * and hidest thy face in the needful time of trouble?\par
2 The ungodly, for his own lust, doth persecute the poor: * let them be taken in the crafty wiliness that they have imagined.\par
3 For the ungodly hath made boast of his own heart's desire, * and speaketh good of the covetous, whom the {\textsc{Lord}} abhorreth.\par
4 The ungodly is so proud, that he careth not for God, * neither is God in all his thoughts.\par
5 His ways are alway grievous; * thy judgements are far above out of his sight, and therefore defieth he all his enemies.\par
6 For he hath said in his heart, Tush, I shall never be cast down, * there shall no harm happen unto me.\par
7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * under his tongue is ungodliness and vanity.\par
8 He sitteth lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, * and privily in his lurking dens doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are set against the poor.\par
9 For he lieth waiting secretly; even as a lion lurketh he in his den, * that he may ravish the poor.\par
10 He doth ravish the poor, * when he getteth him into his net.\par
11 He falleth down, and humbleth himself, * that the congregation of the poor may fall into the hands of his captains.\par
12 He hath said in his heart, Tush, God hath forgotten; * he hideth away his face, and he will never see it.\par
13 Arise, O {\textsc{Lord}} God, and lift up thine hand; * forget not the poor.\par
14 Wherefore should the wicked blaspheme God, * while he doth say in his heart, Tush, thou God carest not for it?\par
15 Surely thou hast seen it; * for thou beholdest ungodliness and wrong, that thou mayest take the matter into thy hand.\par
16 The poor committeth himself unto thee; * for thou art the helper of the friendless.\par
17 Break thou the power of the ungodly and malicious; * search out his ungodliness, until thou find none.\par
18 The {\textsc{Lord}} is King for ever and ever, * and the heathen are perished out of the land.\par
19 {\textsc{Lord}}, thou hast heard the desire of the poor; * thou preparest their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth;\par
20 To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, * that the man of the earth be no more exalted against them.
\psa{Psalm 11: \textit{In Domino confido.}}
\lett{I}{n} the {\textsc{Lord}} put I my trust; * how say ye then to my soul, that she should flee as a bird unto the hill?\par
2 For lo, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their arrows within the quiver, * that they may privily shoot at them which are true of heart.\par
3 If the foundations be destroyed, * what can the righteous do?\par
4 The {\textsc{Lord}} is in his holy temple; * the {\textsc{Lord}}'s seat is in heaven.\par
5 His eyes consider the poor, * and his eyelids try the children of men.\par
6 The {\textsc{Lord}} approveth the righteous: * but the ungodly, and him that delighteth in wickedness, doth his soul abhor.\par
7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest: * this shall be their portion to drink.\par
8 For the righteous {\textsc{Lord}} loveth righteousness; * his countenance will behold the thing that is just.
\subsection{Evening Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 12: \textit{Salvum me fac.}}
\lett{H}{elp} me,{\textsc{Lord}}, for there is not one godly man left; * for the faithful are minished from among the children of men.\par
2 They talk of vanity every one with his neighbour; * they do but flatter with their lips, and dissemble in their double heart.\par
3 The {\textsc{Lord}} shall root out all deceitful lips, * and the tongue that speaketh proud things;\par
4 Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; * we are they that ought to speak; who is lord over us?\par
5 Now, for the comfortless troubles' sake of the needy, * and because of the deep sighing of the poor,\par
6 I will up, saith the {\textsc{Lord}}; * and will help every one from him that swelleth against him, and will set him at rest.\par
7 The words of the {\textsc{Lord}} are pure words; * even as the silver which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire.\par
8 Thou shalt keep them, O {\textsc{Lord}}; * thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.\par
9 The ungodly walk on every side: * when they are exalted, the children of men are put to rebuke.
\psa{Psalm 13: \textit{Usquequo, Domine?}}
\lett{H}{ow} long wilt thou forget me, O {\textsc{Lord}}; for ever? * how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?\par
2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul, and be so vexed in my heart? * how long shall mine enemy triumph over me?\par
3 Consider, and hear me, O {\textsc{Lord}} my God; * lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death;\par
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: * for if I be cast down, they that trouble me will rejoice at it.\par
5 But my trust is in thy mercy, * and my heart is joyful in thy salvation.\par
6 I will sing of the {\textsc{Lord}}, because he hath dealt so lovingly with me; * yea, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most Highest.
\psa{Psalm 14: \textit{Dixit insipiens.}}
\lett{T}{he} fool hath said in his heart, * There is no God.\par
2 They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.\par
3 The \textsc{Lord} looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * to see if there were any that would understand, and seek after God.\par
4 But they are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become abominable; * there is none that doeth good, no not one.\par
5 Have they no knowledge, that they are all such workers of mischief, * eating up my people as it were bread, and call not upon the {\textsc{Lord}}?\par
6 There were they brought in great fear, even where no fear was; * for God is in the generation of the righteous.\par
7 As for you, ye have made a mock at the counsel of the poor; * because he putteth his trust in the {\textsc{Lord}}.\par
8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Sion? * When the {\textsc{Lord}} turneth the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
\subsection{Day 3: Morning Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 15: \textit{Domine, quis habitabit?}}
\lett{L}{ord}, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?\par
2 Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.\par
3 He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.\par
4 He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, * and maketh much of them that fear the {\textsc{Lord}}.\par
5 He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not, * though it were to his own hindrance.\par
6 He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward against the innocent.\par
7 Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.
\psa{Psalm 16: \textit{Conserva me, Domine.}}
\lett{P}{reserve} me, O God; * for in thee have I put my trust.\par
2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the {\textsc{Lord}}, * Thou art my God; I have no good like unto thee.\par
3 All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth, * and upon such as excel in virtue.\par
4 But they that run after another god * shall have great trouble.\par
5 Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, * neither make mention of their names within my lips.\par
6 The {\textsc{Lord}} himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; * thou shalt maintain my lot.\par
7 The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground; * yea, I have a goodly heritage.\par
8 I will thank the {\textsc{Lord}} for giving me warning; * my reins also chasten me in the night season.\par
9 I have set the {\textsc{Lord}} alway before me; * for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.\par
10 Wherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: * my flesh also shall rest in hope.\par
11 For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell; * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.\par
12 Thou shalt show me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulness of joy, * and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.
\psa{Psalm 17: \textit{Exaudi, Domine.}}
\lett{H}{ear} the right, O {\textsc{Lord}}, consider my complaint, * and hearken unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.\par
2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; * and let thine eyes look upon the thing that is equal.\par
3 Thou hast proved and visited mine heart in the night season; thou hast tried me, and shalt find no wickedness in me; * for I am utterly purposed that my mouth shall not offend.\par
4 As for the works of men, * by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the destroyer.\par
5 O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, * that my footsteps slip not.\par
6 I have called upon thee, O God, for thou shalt hear me: * incline thine ear to me, and hearken unto my words.\par
7 Show thy marvellous loving-kindness, thou that art the Saviour of them which put their trust in thee, * from such as resist thy right hand.\par
8 Keep me as the apple of an eye; * hide me under the shadow of thy wings,\par
9 From the ungodly, that trouble me; * mine enemies compass me round about, to take away my soul.\par
10 They are inclosed in their own fat, * and their mouth speaketh proud things.\par
11 They lie waiting in our way on every side, * watching to cast us down to the ground;\par
12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, * and as it were a lion's whelp lurking in secret places.\par
13 Up, {\textsc{Lord}}, disappoint him, and cast him down; * deliver my soul from the ungodly, by thine own sword;\par
14 Yea, by thy hand, O {\textsc{Lord}}; from the men of the evil world; * which have their portion in this life, whose bellies thou fillest with thy hid treasure.\par
15 They have children at their desire, * and leave the rest of their substance for their babes.\par
16 But as for me, I shall behold thy presence in righteousness; * and when I awake up after thy likeness, I shall be satisfied.
\subsection{Evening Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 18: \textit{Diligam te, Domine.}}
\lett{I}{will} love thee, O {\textsc{Lord}}, my strength. * The {\textsc{Lord}} is my stony rock, and my defence;\par
2 My Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust; * my buckler, the horn also of my salvation, and my refuge.\par
3 I will call upon the {\textsc{Lord}}, which is worthy to be praised; * so shall I be safe from mine enemies.\par
4 The sorrows of death compassed me, * and the overflowings of ungodliness made me afraid.\par
5 The pains of hell came about me; * the snares of death overtook me.\par
6 In my trouble I called upon the {\textsc{Lord}}, * and complained unto my God:\par
7 So he heard my voice out of his holy temple, * and my complaint came before him; it entered even into his ears.\par
8 The earth trembled and quaked, * the very foundations also of the hills shook, and were removed, because he was wroth.\par
9 There went a smoke out in his presence, * and a consuming fire out of his mouth, so that coals were kindled at it.\par
10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down, * and it was dark under his feet.\par
11 He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; * he came flying upon the wings of the wind.\par
12 He made darkness his secret place, * his pavilion round about him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him.\par
13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds removed; * hailstones and coals of fire.\par
14 The {\textsc{Lord}} also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder; * hailstones and coals of fire.\par
15 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; * he cast forth lightnings, and destroyed them.\par
16 The springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the round world were discovered, * at thy chiding, O {\textsc{Lord}}, at the blasting of the breath of thy displeasure.\par
17 He sent down from on high to fetch me, * and took me out of many waters.\par
18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, and from them which hate me; * for they were too mighty for me.\par
19 They came upon me in the day of my trouble; * but the {\textsc{Lord}} was my upholder.\par
20 He brought me forth also into a place of liberty; * he brought me forth, even because he had a favour unto me.\par
21 The {\textsc{Lord}} rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * according to the cleanness of my hands did he recompense me.\par
22 Because I have kept the ways of the {\textsc{Lord}}, * and have not forsaken my God, as the wicked doth.\par
23 For I have an eye unto all his laws, * and will not cast out his commandments from me.\par
24 I was also uncorrupt before him, * and eschewed mine own wickedness.\par
25 Therefore the {\textsc{Lord}} rewarded me after my righteous dealing, * and according unto the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.\par
26 With the holy thou shalt be holy, * and with a perfect man thou shalt be perfect.\par
27 With the clean thou shalt be clean, * and with the froward thou shalt be froward.\par
28 For thou shalt save the people that are in adversity, and shalt bring down the high looks of the proud.\par
29 Thou also shalt light my candle; * the {\textsc{Lord}} my God shall make my darkness to be light.\par
30 For in thee I shall discomfit an host of men, * and with the help of my God I shall leap over the wall.\par
31 The way of God is an undefiled way: * the word of the {\textsc{Lord}} also is tried in the fire; he is the defender of all them that put their trust in him.\par
32 For who is God, but the {\textsc{Lord}}? * or who hath any strength, except our God?\par
33 It is God that girdeth me with strength of war, * and maketh my way perfect.\par
34 He maketh my feet like harts' feet, * and setteth me up on high.\par
35 He teacheth mine hands to fight, * and mine arms shall bend even a bow of steel.\par
36 Thou hast given me the defence of thy salvation; * thy right hand also shall hold me up, and thy loving correction shall make me great.\par
37 Thou shalt make room enough under me for to go, * that my footsteps shall not slide.\par
38 I will follow upon mine enemies, and overtake them; * neither will I turn again till I have destroyed them.\par
39 I will smite them, that they shall not be able to stand, * but fall under my feet.\par
40 Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; * thou shalt throw down mine enemies under me.\par
41 Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me, * and I shall destroy them that hate me.\par
42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * yea, even unto the {\textsc{Lord}} shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.\par
43 I will beat them as small as the dust before the wind: * I will cast them out as the clay in the streets.\par
44 Thou shalt deliver me from the strivings of the people, * and thou shalt make me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.\par
45 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * the strangers shall feign obedience unto me.\par
46 The strangers shall fail, * and come trembling out of their strongholds.\par
47 The {\textsc{Lord}} liveth; and blessed be my strong helper, * and praised be the God of my salvation;\par
48 Even the God that seeth that I be avenged, * and subdueth the people unto me.\par
49 It is he that delivereth me from my cruel enemies, and setteth me up above mine adversaries: * thou shalt rid me from the wicked man.\par
50 For this cause will I give thanks unto thee, O {\textsc{Lord}}, among the Gentiles, * and sing praises unto thy Name.\par
51 Great prosperity giveth he unto his King, * and showeth loving-kindness unto David his anointed, and unto his seed for evermore.

\psa{Psalm 19: \textit{Caeli enarrant.}}

3 There is neither speech nor language; * but their voices are heard among them.\par

5 They come in no misfortune like other folk; * neither are they plagued like other men.\par
6 And this is the cause that they are so holden with pride, * and cruelty covereth them as a garment.\par

16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderness, * and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.\par

48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones, * and their mulberry-trees with the frost.\par
49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones, * and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.\par
50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and trouble: * and sent evil angels among them.\par
51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death; * but gave their life over to the pestilence;\par
52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, * the most principal and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.\par
53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep, * and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.\par
54 He brought them out safely, that they should not fear, * and overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.\par
55 And brought them within the borders of his sanctuary, * even to this mountain, which he purchased with his right hand.\par
56 He cast out the heathen also before them, * caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\par
57 Yet they tempted and displeased the Most High God, * and kept not his testimonies.\par
58 They turned their backs, and fell away like their forefathers; * starting aside like a broken bow.\par
59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars, * and provoked him to displeasure with their images.\par

32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people, * and praise him in the seat of the elders!\par
33 He turneth the floods into a wilderness, * and drieth up the water-springs.\par
34 A fruitful land maketh he barren, * for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.\par
35 Again, he maketh the wilderness a standing water, * and water-springs of a dry ground.\par
36 And there he setteth the hungry, * that they may build them a city to dwell in;\par
37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards, * to yield them fruits of increase.\par
38 He blesseth them, so that they multiply exceedingly; * and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.\par
39 And again, when they are minished and brought low * through oppression, through any plague or trouble;\par
40 Though he suffer them to be evil entreated through tyrants, * and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness;\par
41 Yet helpeth he the poor out of misery, * and maketh him households like a flock of sheep.\par
42 The righteous will consider this, and rejoice; * and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped.\par

9 Let the mischief of their own lips fall upon the head of them * that compass me about.\par
10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; * let them be cast into the fire, and into the pit, that they never rise up again.\par
11 A man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth: * evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.\par
12 Sure I am that the {\textsc{Lord}} will avenge the poor, * and maintain the cause of the helpless.\par
13 The righteous also shall give thanks unto thy Name; * and the just shall continue in thy sight.
\subsection{Evening Prayer}
\psa{Psalm 141: \textit{Domine, clamavi.}}
\lett{L}{ord}, I call upon thee; haste thee unto me, * and consider my voice, when I cry unto thee.\par
2 Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense; * and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\par
3 Set a watch, O {\textsc{Lord}}, before my mouth, * and keep the door of my lips.\par
4 O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing; * let me not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness, neither let me eat of such things as please them.\par
5 Let the righteous rather smite me friendly, and reprove me; * yea, let not my head refuse their precious balms.\par
6 As for the ungodly, * I will pray yet against their wickedness.\par
7 Let their judges be overthrown in stony places, * that they may hear my words; for they are sweet.\par
8 Our bones lie scattered before the pit, * like as when one breaketh and heweth wood upon the earth.\par
9 But mine eyes look unto thee, O {\textsc{Lord}} God; * in thee is my trust; O cast not out my soul.\par
10 Keep me from the snare that they have laid for me, * and from the traps of the wicked doers.\par
11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, * and let me ever escape them.
\psa{Psalm 142: \textit{Voce mea ad Dominum.}}
\lett{I}{Cried} unto the {\textsc{Lord}} with my voice; * yea, even unto the {\textsc{Lord}} did I make my supplication.\par
2 I poured out my complaints before him, * and showed him of my trouble.\par
3 When my spirit was in heaviness, thou knewest my path; * in the way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.\par
4 I looked also upon my right hand, * and saw there was no man that would know me.\par
5 I had no place to flee unto, * and no man cared for my soul.\par
6 I cried unto thee, O {\textsc{Lord}}, and said, * Thou art my hope, and my portion in the land of the living.\par
7 Consider my complaint; * for I am brought very low.\par
8 O deliver me from my persecutors; * for they are too strong for me.\par
9 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto thy Name; * which thing if thou wilt grant me, then shall the righteous resort unto my company.
\psa{Psalm 143: \textit{Domine, exaudi.}}
\lett{H}{ear} my prayer, O {\textsc{Lord}}, and consider my desire; * hearken unto me for thy truth and righteousness' sake.\par
2 And enter not into judgement with thy servant; * for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.\par
3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; * he hath laid me in the darkness, as the men that have been long dead.\par
4 Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, * and my heart within me is desolate.\par
5 Yet do I remember the time past; I muse upon all thy works; * yea, I exercise myself in the works of thy hands.\par
6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee; * my soul gaspeth unto thee as a thirsty land.\par
7 Hear me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, and that soon; for my spirit waxeth faint: * hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.\par
8 O let me hear thy loving-kindness betimes in the morning; for in thee is my trust: * show thou me the way that I should walk in; for I lift up my soul unto thee.\par
9 Deliver me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, from mine enemies; * for I flee unto thee to hide me.\par
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleaseth thee; for thou art my God: * let thy loving Spirit lead me forth into the land of righteousness.\par
11 Quicken me, O {\textsc{Lord}}, for thy Name's sake; * and for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.\par
12 And of thy goodness slay mine enemies, * and destroy all them that vex my soul; for I am thy servant.
